## Thoughts
- How to proceed to next
  - Have one base card with back shown on bottom (lvl 0)
  - Have another card with back shown (lvl 1)
  - Have the card we are viewing on top with front shown (lvl 2)
  - Stack the cards so that the 3 show the edges
    - Maybe do not do this for simplicity sakes
  - When lvl2 card swiped away, flip lvl1 card
